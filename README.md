## 🧪 Machine Learning Models Used

| Model              | Precision | Recall | F1 Score | Accuracy |
|-------------------|-----------|--------|----------|----------|
| Decision Tree      | 0.80      | 0.70   | 0.74     | 93%      |
| SVM                | 0.84      | 0.81   | 0.82     | 93%      |
| Boosted Ensemble   | 0.98      | 0.98   | 0.98     | 95% ✅    |

✅ **Boosted Ensemble** gave the best results and was used in the final IEEE publication!
